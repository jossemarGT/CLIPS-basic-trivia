;;;======================================================
;;;   Animal Identification Expert System
;;;
;;;     A simple expert system which attempts to identify
;;;     an animal based on its characteristics.
;;;     The knowledge base in this example is a 
;;;     collection of facts which represent backward
;;;     chaining rules. CLIPS forward chaining rules are
;;;     then used to simulate a backward chaining inference
;;;     engine.
;;;
;;;     CLIPS Version 6.0 Example
;;; 
;;;     To execute, merely load, reset, and run.
;;;     Answer questions yes or no.
