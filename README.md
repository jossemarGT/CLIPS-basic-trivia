#Basic Trivia CLIPS
**WARNING** CLIPS is some kind of functional programming language, that's why almost everything is written in Spanish :P (it was much easy to implement in my mother language)

Basic trivia is a small expert system which implements backward chaining rules for the inference process and has a similar behavior to the core example "animals.clp".

So, `(load) (reset) (run)` if you want to check how does it work.
